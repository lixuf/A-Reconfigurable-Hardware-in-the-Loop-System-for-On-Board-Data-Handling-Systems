# A-Reconfigurable-Hardware-in-the-Loop-System-for-On-Board-Data-Handling-Systems

During the development of On-Board Data Handling (OBDH) systems, it is essential to manufacture Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) system for testing OBDH systems. As OBDH systems become increasingly complex, the time and cost involved in manufacturing HIL system have escalated, gradually becoming a major factor affecting the development. In order to expedite the development of OBDH systems, we conducted an analysis of OBDH systems development tasks. Based on this analysis, we propose a reconfigurable HIL system that can be applied to OBDH system currently in development or those about to be initiated. The proposed system can be easily configured for various OBDH systems, eliminating the need to develop dedicated HIL system for each OBDH system development task. The proposed system is based on the concept of reconfigurable design which ensures its generality and reusability at the program, hardware, and FPGA levels and features a straightforward, cost-effective architecture, comprising solely a host computer and a highly integrated hardware board. This innovative system provides a cost-effective and efficient solution for development.
